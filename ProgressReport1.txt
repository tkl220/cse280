## Summary of Work Completed


This week we formed our groups, began talking about the type of project we would all like to work on, and created a github and shared google drive.


### Goals completed this week


The goal completed from last week is simply creating our group, discussing possible projects, and creating a repository on github.
URL for repository: https://github.com/tkl220/cse280


### Goals not met this week


We have not decided on a project yet.


### Challenges faced this week


We did not face any challenges as it is the first week.


### Goals for next week


Our goals for next week are to work with our project manager to decide on a project idea, and then begin brainstorming how we will approach the project. Essentially, we need to make a plan going forward about how we will work on our project as a group.


We have two projects that we are most interested in from the list of suggested projects. One of the projects we are interested in is working on the Miniature Driverless Car project, and the second we are interested in is the Large-Scale Document Analysis, Mining, and Visualization to Advance the Fight Against Gender-Based Violence.
