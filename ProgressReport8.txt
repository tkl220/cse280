# Progress Report 8

## Summary of Work Completed

This week, the group worked on learning more about Ackermann steering, as well as learning more
about nodes in ROS and considered how best to package together the nodes. Overall, we started setting
up our project with the new remote setup and continued to toggle with some issues related to ROS.

### Goals completed this week

-- becoming smart on Ackermann steering and nodes in ROS
-- starting to form network of nodes

### Goals not met this week

-- We were unable to fully complete all of our goals from last week, but we did make progress on 
each of them
-- we found that we each reached a point where we needed to talk through things with Prof Montella,
which we did on Thursday

### Challenges faced this week

Faced some challenges of all being remote and it being hard to have quick responses sometimes
necessary to move on with our work.

### Goals for next week

-- make more progress on the Ackermann steering model and get something working in code 
-- continue working with the nodes and create the network of nodes

## Individual Member Contributions

For each group member, list the individual contributions, and a link to proof in the form of a commit to your group repository. At the end, provide an estimate for how many hours these contributions took to complete.
